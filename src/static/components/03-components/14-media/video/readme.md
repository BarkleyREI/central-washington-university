**Image Direction:** The poster image should visually support the video's subject matter and purpose. The image within this component scales proportionately across all viewports so a designated safe area is not required.  Images should be uploaded as .jpg file type, have a file size of 500 KB or less to help your site load quickly, and have a RGB color profile. You don't need to be concerned about DPI and PPI because they only affect an image's print quality, not its web display.
