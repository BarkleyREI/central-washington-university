**Image/Video Dimensions:** 16:9 Ratio, 1264px x 711px

**Image Direction:** The image should visually support the component's subject matter and purpose.
The image within this component scales proportionately across all viewports so a designated safe area is not required. 
Images should be uploaded as .jpg file type, have a file size of 500 KB or less to help your site load quickly, and have a RGB color profile. You don't need to be concerned about DPI and PPI because they only affect an image's print quality, not its web display.
CWU Photo & Video Style: Create and use images that convey the spirit of campus, teaching and learning, and what it means to be a Wildcat. CWU’s brand promise, We See Futures, can be illustrated in photos and videos that show: the range of individual possibilities for each student, CWU deeply embedded in the community, building careers for today and tomorrow, strengths and possibilities for the future. Follow best practices for inclusive and diverse photography with images that are representative without over-selling. Images must be genuine, depicting situations that truly occur on campus. Imagery that falsely reflects the reality on campus risks marginalizing students and can diminish CWU’s reputation. Avoid stereotyping and misidentifying individuals and groups. Represent diversity beyond skin color and broaden representations beyond students.
