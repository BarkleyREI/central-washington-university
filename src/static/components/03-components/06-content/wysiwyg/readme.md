**Required/Optional:** Optional

**Dynamic:** No

**Repeatable:** Yes

**Image/Video Dimensions:** 4:3 Ratio (836px x 627px)

**Image Direction:** The image should visually support the content of the WYSIWYG. The image within this component scales proportionately across all viewports so a designated safe area is not required. Images should be uploaded as .jpg file type, have a file size of 500 KB or less to help your site load quickly, and have a RGB color profile. You don’t need to be concerned about DPI and PPI because they only affect an image’s print quality, not its web display.
