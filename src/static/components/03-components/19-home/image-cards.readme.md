CWU Photo & Video Style: Create and use images that convey the spirit of campus, teaching and learning, and what it means to be a Wildcat. CWU’s brand promise, We See Futures, can be illustrated in photos and videos that show: the range of individual possibilities for each student, CWU deeply embedded in the community, building careers for today and tomorrow, strengths and possibilities for the future. Follow best practices for inclusive and diverse photography with images that are representative without over-selling. Images must be genuine, depicting situations that truly occur on campus. Imagery that falsely reflects the reality on campus risks marginalizing students and can diminish CWU’s reputation. Avoid stereotyping and misidentifying individuals and groups. Represent diversity beyond skin color and broaden representations beyond students.
